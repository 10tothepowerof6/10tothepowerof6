## /whoami

I am a university student driven by two obsessions: **intelligent adaptive systems** and **immersive storytelling**. While my academic focus is Artificial Intelligence, my heart lies in Game Development. I don't just write code; I craft experiences.

**The name `10tothepowerof6`:**
Mathematically, $10^6 = 1,000,000$. In Vietnamese, one million is "Triệu". It is a blend of identity, mathematics, and a bit of wordplay.

## /development-focus

### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence
Focusing on **LLMs**, **Generative AI**, and **Agentic Behaviors**. My goal is to move beyond static scripts to create dynamic, responsive entities.

### 🎮 Game Engineering
Currently developing a **Survival Horror / Puzzle** title with a Y2K Cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Core Mechanics:** Non-Euclidean loops, resource management (dynamic lighting decay), and anomaly detection.
*   **Technical Challenge:** optimizing render pipelines and managing state machines for unpredictable horror elements.

## /personality-matrix

*   **Deep Focus:** I possess a hyper-focused workflow (ADHD trait) that allows me to obsess over micro-details for extended periods.
*   **Curiosity over Consumption:** I spend less time playing games and more time reverse-engineering them.
*   **Refactor Addiction:** I have a tendency to turn a simple variable tweak into a full system architecture rewrite for the sake of "clean code."
